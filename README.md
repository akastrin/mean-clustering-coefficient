# Mean clustering coeffcient

## Introduction

A clustering coefficient quentifies the tendency of neighboring nodes to form highly connected clusters. Kaiser (2008) proposed the adjusted clustering coefficient obtained after removing the nodes with less than two neighbours. With this approach the clustering coefficient value with degree less than 2 is not averaged.

This repository provides `R` and `Rcpp` implementation of the Kaiser's (2008) mean clustering coefficient.
